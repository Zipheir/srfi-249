<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>When an exceptional situation is encountered by a program, it may
create a <dfn>condition</dfn> object describing the situation and then
signal the condition and pass control to a condition handler. The
signaler and handler are two different parts of a system, between which
there is a barrier of abstraction. In order to recover gracefully and
flexibly from exceptional situations, however, the signaler can provide
multiple ways by which the handler can restart the computation, some of
which may require extra input. Often, the decision of which method of
recovery to choose is left up to a human user, who may be prompted for
the input needed to recover. This SRFI proposes a simple mechanism
called <dfn>restarters</dfn> to encapsulate the information necessary to
restart a computation with associated interactive prompters.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The fit between restarters and the Scheme exception system is
    awkward. It’s natural to invoke restarts in response to exceptions,
    but only continuable exceptions can be restarted.</p>

    <p>I think the author of a restartable process must make the following
    contract: if a problem is restartable, it will be signaled by a
    continuable exception. Even then, there are complications:
    the values returned by the restarter will come through
    <code>raise-continuable</code>, and the number and type of these
    values may not match the process’s expectations.</p>

    <p>In any case, this doesn’t make it any easier to provide restarts
    for exceptions raised by the Scheme system, since these are usually
    non-continuable. This leads to …</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Adapting existing procedures to provide restarts is hard. Marc
    Nieper-Wißkirchen gives the apparently simple problem of allowing
    argument substitution in the following procedure:</p>

    <pre><code>(define (f x y)
  (assert (number? x))
  (assert (string? y))
  (list (number-&gt;string x) (string-&gt;number y)))</code></pre>

    <p>We’d like to fit this with restarts which allow an invalid
    <var>x</var> or <var>y</var> argument to be replaced by the caller.
    With the current restarter model, this turns out to be a tedious
    transformation that is quite difficult to get right. An attempt
    follows:</p>

    <pre><code>;; Define bad-x-condition and bad-y-condition …

(define (get-single-argument-from-restart pred condition)
  (let check-loop ()
    (call-with-values
     (lambda () (raise-continuable condition))
     (case-lambda
       ((x) (if (pred x) x (check-loop)))
       (xs (check-loop))))))  ; try again

(define (f x y)
  (define replace-x
    (make-restarter 'replace-x
      '("Replace the x argument." "The number to use.")
      (lambda (x*) (set! x x*))))

  (define replace-y
    (make-restarter 'replace-y
     '("Replace the y argument." "The string to use.")
     (lambda (y*) (set! y y*))))

  (with-restarters
   (list replace-x replace-y)
   (lambda ()
     (let* ((pred-y (lambda (z) (and (string? z)
                                     (string-&gt;number z))))
            (x (if (number? x)
                   x
                   (get-single-argument-from-restart
                    number?
                    (make-bad-x-condition x))))
            (y (if (pred-y y)
                   y
                   (get-single-argument-from-restart
                    pred-y
                    (make-bad-y-condition y)))))
       ;; Actual procedure body!
       (list (number-&gt;string x) (string-&gt;number y))))))</code></pre>

    <p>(Thanks to MNW for helping to work this out.)</p>

    <p>A few points about this example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>In general, it seems that restarters must work by mutation,
      rather than by returning values to the original continuation. This
      is because a restarter, once it is added to the
      <code>ambient-restarters</code>, may be invoked just about anywhere.
      Thus the following would be subtly wrong:</p>

      <pre><code>(define (f x y)
  (with-restarters
   (list (make-restarter 'replace-x
           '("Replace the x argument." "The value to use.")
           values)
         (make-restarter 'replace-y
           '("Replace the y argument." "The value to use.")
           values))
   (lambda ()
     (let ((x (if (number? x)
                  x
                  (get-single-argument-from-restart
                   number?
                   (make-bad-x-condition x))))
           (y (if (string? y)
                  y
                  (get-single-argument-from-restart
                   string?
                   (make-bad-y-condition y)))))
       (list (number-&gt;string x) (string-&gt;number y))))))</code></pre>

        <p>The problem is that, if the <var>y</var> argument needs to
        be replaced, the user will be presented with the
        <code>replace-x</code> restart (which has not been unregistered,
        of course) as an option—but this restarter, if selected, will
        return a value to replace <em><var>y</var></em>, instead. There
        is a possibility of serious confusion here; thus the mutative
        restarters used in the main example.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>A procedure, <code>get-single-argument-from-restart</code>,
      is used to get a single, valid argument value from the restart.
      This might be put into the restarter procedure itself, but
      something of this sort is necessary when processing values
      returned by restarters.</p></li>

      <li><p><code>string-&gt;number</code> is called twice, the first
      time to check whether the value of <var>y</var> can be
      converted to a number. This only works as a test because of
      <code>string-&gt;number</code>’s semantics. If it raised a
      (non-continuable) exception instead of returning false, we
      could not restart with a new value at all. (i.e. this is
      a brittle approach that can’t be used with all procedures.)
      </p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>An effective and flexible system for gracefully handling and
recovering from exceptional situations is a necessity for any large
software system. Most condition or exception systems provide only a
one-way flow of information from the signaler to the handler, however:
they offer no way to communicate possible methods of recovery to the
signaler. Common Lisp, MIT Scheme, and Dylan are almost unique in this
regard: they provide comprehensive facilities for restarting in exceptional
situations. This proposal is considerably simpler than Common Lisp’s or
Dylan’s restart systems, more in the spirit of Scheme, however. It is
historically related to MIT Scheme’s system.</p>

<p>One important feature for a restart system to provide is
interactivity. Though purely programmatic condition recovery is
useful, it is well-acknowledged by the designers and users of Common
Lisp’s condition system that the ability to <em>interactively</em>
choose a method of recovery for a condition is useful. This ability,
built-in to the Common Lisp language, is one of the primary reasons
for the power of Common Lisp development and debugging environments.
Though much of the baggage in Common Lisp’s restart system was deemed
unnecessary for this proposal, interactivity is one crucial feature
that was included. In this SRFI, the interactivity is provided by an
<dfn>interactor procedure</dfn> that by default is provided by the
implementation, but can be overridden by the user.</p>

<p>One major difference between the CL and Scheme condition systems is
that when a CL handler exits to its caller, the next outer handler is
invoked, whereas when a Scheme handler exits, either the code that
raised the condition is resumed (if <code>raise-continuably</code> was
used), or another error is signaled (if <code>raise</code> was used);
the condition must be re-raised in order to give the next outer handler
control. Therefore, in CL the only way for the signaler to regain
control is through a restart, but in Scheme restarts are just one way of
handling returns from exceptions.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p>A <dfn>restarter</dfn> is an object of a new disjoint type with three
fields:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>tag</dt>
  <dd>a symbol identifying this restarter</dd>

  <dt>description</dt>
  <dd>a list of strings that describes the method
  of recovery and the values, if any, needed for recovery</dd>
  <dt>invoker</dt>

  <dd>a procedure that actually performs the recovery;
  the number of arguments it expects is equal to the length of
  <var>description</var> minus 1.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Restarters can be available in one of two ways. They can be
<dfn>ambient restarters</dfn>, each of which is available during some
dynamic extent of the program, or they can be the value of some variable
or part of some data structure.</p>

<h3 id="procedures">Procedures</h3>

<p><code>(make-restarter </code><var>tag description
invoker</var><code>)</code> → <span class="type-meta">restarter</span></p>

<p>Returns a restarter with the specified tag, description, and
invoker.</p>

<p>The <var>tag</var> argument is a symbol.</p>

<p>The <var>description</var> argument is a list whose car is a string
that describes the effect of invoking the restarter. By convention it is
a complete sentence in a natural language using the standard punctuation
conventions of that language. It may also be a question or a command.
The cdr of <var>description</var> is a list of strings that describe the
values to be passed to the invoker in the same natural language: they
may be phrases or whole sentences.</p>

<p>The <var>invoker</var> argument is a recovery procedure.</p>

<p>Examples of creating restarters to help recover from division by
zero:</p>

<pre><code>(define return-zero-restarter
  (make-restarter 'return-zero
   '("Return zero.")
   (lambda () 0)))

(define return-value-restarter
  (make-restarter 'return-value
    '("Return a specified value" "The value to return")
    (lambda (x) x)))</code></pre>

<p><code>(restarter? </code><var>obj</var><code>)</code> →
<span class="type-meta">boolean</span></p>

<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <var>obj</var> is a restarter and
<code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>(restarter? return-zero-restarter) → #t
(restarter? 20) → #f</code></pre>

<p><code>(restarter-tag </code><var>restarter</var><code>)</code> →
<span class="type-meta">tag</span><br />

<code>(restarter-description </code><var>restarter</var><code>)</code> →
<span class="type-meta">list-of-strings</span></p>

<p>Returns the tag / description of <var>restarter</var>. It is an error
to mutate <var>list-of-strings</var> or any of its members.</p>

<p>Example: accessing fields of <code>return-zero-restarter</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(restarter-tag return-zero-restarter) → return-zero
(restarter-description return-zero-restarter) → ("Return zero.")</code></pre>

<p><code>(restart </code><var>restarter</var> <var>arg</var>
…<code>)</code> →
<span class="type-meta">values</span> (may not return)</p>

<p>Invokes the invoker procedure of <var>restarter</var> on the
<var>args</var>, and returns however many values the invoker does. If the
invoker does not return, <code>restart</code> does not return
either.</p>

<p>Invoking the <code>return-zero</code> restarter:</p>

<pre><code>(restart return-zero) → 0</code></pre>

<p><code>(ambient-restarters)</code></p>

<p>Returns the current list of ambient restarters created by
<code>make-restarter</code> and established by
<code>with-restarter</code>. It is an error to mutate this list.
<code>Ambient-restarters</code> is normally a SRFI 39 / R7RS parameter,
but directly modifying it with <code>parameterize</code> should be
avoided.</p>

<p><code>(with-restarters </code><var>restarters</var>
<var>thunk</var><code>)</code></p>

<p>Establishes <var>restarters</var>, which may be a single restarter, a
list of restarters, or a SRFI 222 compound object, as ambient restarters
on top of the existing ambient restarters. It is an error if any of the
restarters specified by <var>restarters</var> have the same tag. Then
<code>with-restarter</code> invokes <var>thunk</var> with no arguments,
after which the restarters are disestablished and
<code>with-restarter</code> returns whatever <var>thunk</var> returns.</p>

<p><code>(find-restarter </code><var>tag restarters</var><code>)</code> →
<span class="type-meta">restarter</span> or <code>#f</code></p>

<p>Searches <var>restarters</var> for a restarter whose tag is the same
(in the sense of <code>symbol=?</code>) as <var>tag</var>. The
<var>restarters</var> argument may be a single restarter, a list of
restarters, or a <a
href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-222/srfi-222.html">SRFI 222</a>
compound object. If no such restarter is found in <var>restarters</var>,
the value of <code>(ambient-restarters)</code> is searched instead.
Failing that as well, <code>#f</code> is returned.</p>

<p><code>(collect-restarters
</code><var>restarters</var><code>)</code></p>

<p>The argument <var>restarters</var> has the same semantics as the
<var>restarters</var> argument of <code>find-restarter</code>. All
available restarters are collected into a list which is then returned,
giving the restarters in <var>restarters</var> priority over the
restarters in <code>(ambient-restarters)</code>, but excluding those
whose tag is the same (in the sense of <code>symbol=?</code>) as a
higher-priority restarter already on the list. Note that if
<var>restarters</var> is a list, earlier elements in the list take
priority over later ones, and the same is true for subobjects in a
compound object.</p>

<p><code>interactor</code></p>

<p>A SRFI 39 / R7RS parameter whose value is an interactor procedure.
The general contract of such a procedure is as follows:</p>

<p>It accepts one argument, a list of restarters. The tags and the cars
of the descriptions of the restarters are made available to the user.
The user is then allowed to choose one of the tags.<br />
Then the remaining strings in the description of the chosen restarter
are made available to the user, and the user is allowed to specify a
value corresponding to each string.</p>

<p>The interactor then calls <code>restart</code> on the restarter and
the user’s values and returns whatever <code>restart</code> returns.</p>

<p>The sample interactor outputs the tags and description strings with
<code>display</code> and reads the chosen tag and values using
<code>read</code>. Here is a possible example of the interaction:</p>

<pre><code>The following actions are available:
return-zero: Return zero.
return-numerator: Return the numerator.
use-value: Choose a value to return.
abort: Abort the computation.

Which action do you choose:  use-value
What is the value you wish to use? 32</code></pre>

<p>In this case the restarter will return 32.</p>

<p><code>(restart-interactively </code><var>restarters</var><code>)</code>
→ <span class="type-meta">values</span> (may not return)</p>

<p>Equivalent to
<code>((interactor) (collect-restarters
</code><var>restarters</var><code>))</code></p>

<h3 id="standard-restart-tags">Standard restart tags</h3>

<p>The following tags by convention hold to particular behaviour
protocols:</p>

<dl>
  <dt class="tag-name">abort</dt>

  <dd><p>Completely aborts the computation, usually returning to
  some sort of initial user input such as a REPL. The invoker of an
  <code>abort</code> restarter accepts zero arguments, is typically an
  ambient restarter, and normally does not return.</p></dd>

  <dt class="tag-name">ignore</dt>

  <dd><p>Ignores the condition and proceeds. The invoker of an
  <code>ignore</code> restarter accepts zero arguments, is typically an
  ambient restarter, and normally returns an unspecified value.</p></dd>

  <dt class="tag-name">retry</dt>

  <dd><p>Simply retries a whole computation from a certain point, with
  no explicitly altered inputs. Some implicit environmental changes are
  expected to have taken place. The invoker of a <code>retry</code>
  restarter accepts zero arguments, may or may not be an ambient
  restarter, and normally returns an unspecified value.</p></dd>

  <dt class="tag-name">use-value</dt>

  <dd><p>Retries a computation with a given input value substituted
  for some invalid value in the original input. The invoker of a
  <code>use-value</code> restarter accepts at least one argument,
  the new value(s) to substitute. It is may or may not be an ambient
  restarter, and normally returns an unspecified value.</p></dd>

  <dt class="tag-name">store-value</dt>

  <dd><p>These restarter tag is in every respect like
  <code>use-value</code> restarters except that it is meant to store the
  input value somewhere, so that the old one is completely replaced,
  rather than just using the input value temporarily and possibly
  accidentally reusing the old value later and signaling another
  error.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="additional-recommendations">Additional recommendations</h2>

<p>It is highly recommended that Scheme systems integrate restarters
into their condition systems and debuggers. This can be achieved by
using SRFI 222 compound objects to represent conditions, with restarters
as members to represent suitable recovery strategies among the
subobjects.</p>
